        <h3>2. Mindfulness and Focus</h3>
        <p>When you're in the kitchen, all your attention is focused on the task at hand. From measuring ingredients to mixing batter, baking requires concentration and mindfulness. This focused attention can help calm a busy mind and reduce stress and anxiety.</p>

        <h3>4. Emotional Comfort</h3>
        <p>Many people associate baking with fond memories of home and family. The smell of freshly baked cookies or the taste of a warm slice of pie can evoke feelings of comfort and nostalgia, providing emotional support during difficult times.</p>
